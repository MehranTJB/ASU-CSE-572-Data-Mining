##  ASU-CSE572-Data-Mining

Once called “knowledge discovery in databases,” the field of data mining continues to evolve.
Advances in processing power and speed over the last decade have allowed users to move beyond
manual, tedious, and time-consuming practices to quick, easy data analysis that harnesses the power
of machine learning and high performance computing. This course will introduce you to the
fundamentals of data mining and pattern recognition. You will gain a deeper understanding of data
through hands-on experience in the topic areas of big data analysis, classification, clustering, and association rule mining. Advanced topics such as reinforcement learning, deep learning, transfer
learning, and Deep Mind for Google will also be covered. By the end of this course, you will be able to
apply state of the art data mining technology to real world applications, analyze and compare
competing techniques, and design optimal solutions for a given set of application driven constraints.
Specific topics covered include:
- Data Mining Fundamentals
- Data Collection
- Data Visualization
- Data Mining Algorithms
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
